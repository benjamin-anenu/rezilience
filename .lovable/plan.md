# Add 6 More Solana Services to Ecosystem Docs

## Overview

Expand the Ecosystem Documentation from 23 to 29 services by adding **Underdog Protocol**, **Ankr**, **Marginfi**, **Kamino**, **Sanctum**, and **Tiplink** -- all with proper developer docs, API sections, and direct links.

## New Services

| Service | Category | What It Does |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Underdog Protocol** | NFTs | NFT infrastructure for loyalty programs, memberships, and token-gated access |
| **Ankr** | RPC & Data | Multi-chain RPC provider with premium Solana endpoints and advanced APIs |
| **Marginfi** | DeFi | Lending and borrowing protocol with SDK for building on top of margin accounts |
| **Kamino** | DeFi | Automated liquidity vaults, lending, and leveraged yield strategies |
| **Sanctum** | DeFi | Liquid staking aggregator -- LST liquidity layer and the Infinity pool |
| **Tiplink** | Wallets | Send crypto and NFTs via shareable links, no wallet required for recipients |

## File Changes

| File | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| `src/data/solana-docs.ts` | **EDIT** | Append 6 new service entries with full metadata, tags, and API doc sections |
| `src/pages/Library.tsx` | **EDIT** | Update room card count from "23 services" to "29 services" |

No new categories needed -- all 6 fit into existing categories (NFTs, RPC & Data, DeFi, Wallets).

## Details per Service

Each service entry will include 3-4 documentation subsections with direct links to official pages covering SDKs, APIs, CLI tools, and integration guides.
